# quirkyconfigs
Howdy!
Contrary to what the name might suggest there really isn't anything particularly special about this repo. Quirky configs is simply a way for me to back up all of my most used .config subfolders and files in one place (with an ocasionally /etc/ denizen here and there). Feel free to clone anything that might tickle your fancy.
Ta-ra!
